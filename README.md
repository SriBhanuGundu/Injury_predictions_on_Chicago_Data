# Data 602 Final Project:

## Dataset:
   Dataset is referenced from Chicago data portal "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if" for the year 2022
   
## Project Proposal / Business outcome:
  Traffic accidents are responsible for most of the deaths. Especially, in USA there are millions of deaths reported every year. Injuries during the accident depends on the several aspects like road conditions, weather conditions, road defects, speed limit, device conditions and light conditions in particular street. So, I am working on the dataset of Chicago for prediction of injuries and no injuries during traffic accidents due to various conditions in the year 2022.
